- ✅ `notifications` - System notifications
- ✅ `attendance` - Check-in/out records
- ✅ `comments` - Project/task comments
- ✅ `pending_updates` - Approval workflow
- ✅ `erp_settings` - Company settings and configuration

### Table Relationships
```
teammates (1:N) → projects (createdById)
teammates (M:N) → projects (teamMemberIds)
clients (1:N) → projects
projects (1:N) → tasks
teammates (1:N) → tasks (assignedToId)
teammates (1:N) → time_logs
teammates (1:N) → salaries
teammates (1:N) → notifications (userId)
teammates (1:N) → attendance
projects/tasks (1:N) → comments (parentId)
projects/tasks (1:N) → pending_updates (itemId)
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Strategy

### Migration Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Load from database on app startup
useEffect(() => {
  const loadData = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await loadFromDatabase.moduleName();
      setModuleData(data || fallbackData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Database load failed:', error);
      setModuleData(fallbackData);
    } finally {
      setModuleLoaded(true);
    }
  };
  loadData();
}, []);

// 2. Save to database on changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (moduleLoaded) {
    const saveData = async () => {
      try {
        await DatabaseOperations.updateModule(moduleData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Database save failed:', error);
        // Could implement retry logic or offline queue
      }
    };
    saveData();
  }
}, [moduleData, moduleLoaded]);
```

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to localStorage if database fails
2. **User Feedback**: Show connection status and retry options
3. **Offline Support**: Queue operations for when connection returns
4. **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity before database operations

### Performance Optimization
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed
2. **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategies
3. **Batch Operations**: Group database operations where possible
4. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Only for frequently changing data
